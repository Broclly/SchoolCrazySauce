                    As someone who has played quite a while on the game "No Man's Sky", I feel I should have
                    the ability to makes some comments on the gameplay itself. The visuals in this game are stunning,
                    boasting detailed planets that can be fully explored, randomly generated events and spaceships that
                    are quite the eyecatcher. The idea behind this game cannot be ignored either, as the insane size of 
                    solar systems, stars, and planets that can be discovered is unrivaled by games even 8 years after the 
                    games release date. Plus the ability to play multiplayer creates unforgettable experiences for people 
                    of all ages. The sheer complexity and beauty of this game cannot be summed up in 200 words, so I 
                    highly recommend that you experience it for yourself.
